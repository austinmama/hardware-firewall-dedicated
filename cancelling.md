# Canceling a Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)
{: #canceling-a-hardware-firewall-dedicated-}

Your Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) can be cancelled at any time, by performing the procedure here.
{: shortdesc}

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window} and log into your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the top left, then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. Select **Network > IP Management > VLANs** and click on the firewall device you want to cancel.
4. From the **Device Details** page, click on the **Actions** drop down menu and choose **Cancel Device**. In the confirmation dialog, choose whether you want to cancel immediately or in the next billing cycle. Click **Continue** to cancel the device.

Cancelling the firewall will leave all devices on the VLAN without frontend firewall protection. This service is provided month to month and billing will be discontinued for the next month upon cancellation.
